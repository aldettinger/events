## J4K - October 2021

I've been selected for J4K to show Camel Quarkus running in a serverless setup.

As an experienced speaker, my colleague [Claus Ibsen](https://github.com/davsclaus) was able to adapt.

## SnowCamp at Grenoble - February 2022

I've animated a [3 hours workshop](https://snowcamp2022.sched.com/event/qHQ9/workshop-sur-lintegration-a-lere-du-cloud-avec-camel-quarkus) about Camel Quarkus in french.
The 12 participants were really studious and grateful that the workshop was so well prepared.

[The 45 minutes talk](https://snowcamp2022.sched.com/event/qHQy/integration-a-lere-du-cloud-avec-camel-quarkus) in french was a bit challenging due to technical issues fixed at the last second.
At the end of the day, my colleague [Zineb Bendhiba](https://github.com/zbendhiba) was even able to fix the demo on the fly.
We had around 15 attendees to the talk and everyone was involved to create a great interactive exchange.

## Paris JUG - February 2022

Right after SnowCamp, it was really easy to present [Integration with Camel Quarkus in the cloud era](https://youtu.be/LAFUKrSSa9A?t=5) at the [Paris JUG](https://www.parisjug.org/xwiki/wiki/oldversion/view/Meeting/20220208) in french again.

## Devoxx FR at Paris - April 2022

The [3h Hands-on Labs about Camel Quarkus](https://cfp.devoxx.fr/2022/talk/NOF-9542/Integration_a_l'ere_du_cloud_avec_Camel_Quarkus) in the cloud era was approved for Devoxx FR 2022.
A tens of person attended the workshop. The audience interest was a bit split. Some would like a focus on Camel and others on Quarkus.
At the end of the day, the workshop went well and people shared some great feedback with us.
And few seconds from the lab have even been integrated in the [Devoxx FR video trailer](https://youtu.be/a0tFfx1VnQM?t=31) :)

## Voxxed Days at Luxembourg - June 2022

The path of evangelization led me to Luxembourg for a one hour talk in french named [Intégration à l'ère du cloud avec Camel Quarkus](https://cfp-voxxed-lux.yajug.org/2022/talk/HKL-0341/Integration_a_l'ere_du_cloud_avec_Camel_Quarkus). There was around 40 people attending. Based on questions from previous conferences, I demoed the enpoint DSL this time. It was well received by the audience.
The video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taCIEEQCjeM).

## J4K - September 2022
The conference will finally turn online so I will be able to attend. The knative part of the demo was first created for J4K 2021.
So, it's finally a fair return to be able to perform this presentation at J4K one year later.
Video link and number of attendees should be available soon.

## Devoxx Morocco - October 2022
Devoxx Morocco will occur in Taghazout this year. The Camel Quarkus workshop was noticed by the organizers and [selected for the conference](https://devoxx.ma/talk/?id=2171).
After few administrative hiccups, everything should now be ready to spread the Camel Quarkus knowledge in Africa too.
Video link and number of attendees should be available soon.

## Basel One - October 2022
It will be a good occasion to evangelize the [Camel Quarkus workshop](https://baselone.ch/speech.html?id=08CA4481-7EBE-44BF-B88E-5FEA9519FB18) and meet my colleague Peter Palaga.
Video link and number of attendees should be available soon.
