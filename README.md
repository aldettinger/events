Apache CON North America was turned into a remote conference due to the COVID.
I've shared a demo in english about how to [Get started with Camel Quarkus](https://youtu.be/POWsZnGhVHM?t=25).

## J4K - October 2021

I've been selected for J4K to show Camel Quarkus running in a serverless setup.
However, due to technical issues I was not able to join.
As an experienced speaker, my colleague [Claus Ibsen](https://github.com/davsclaus) was able to adapt.

## SnowCamp at Grenoble - February 2022

I've animated a [3 hours workshop](https://snowcamp2022.sched.com/event/qHQ9/workshop-sur-lintegration-a-lere-du-cloud-avec-camel-quarkus) about Camel Quarkus in french.
The 12 participants were really studious and grateful that the workshop was so well prepared.

[The 45 minutes talk](https://snowcamp2022.sched.com/event/qHQy/integration-a-lere-du-cloud-avec-camel-quarkus) in french was a bit challenging due to technical issues fixed at the last second.
At the end of the day, my colleague [Zineb Bendhiba](https://github.com/zbendhiba) was even able to fix the demo on the fly.
We had around 15 attendees to the talk and everyone was involved to create a great interactive exchange.

## Paris JUG - February 2022

Right after SnowCamp, it was really easy to present [Integration with Camel Quarkus in the cloud era](https://youtu.be/LAFUKrSSa9A?t=5) at the [Paris JUG](https://www.parisjug.org/events/2022/02-08-cloud-camel-quarkus/) in french again.
There was around 40 participants with some very creative questions.

## Devoxx FR at Paris - April 2022

The [3h Hands-on Labs about Camel Quarkus](https://cfp.devoxx.fr/2022/talk/NOF-9542/Integration_a_l'ere_du_cloud_avec_Camel_Quarkus) in the cloud era was approved for Devoxx FR 2022.
A tens of person attended the workshop. The audience interest was a bit split. Some would like a focus on Camel and others on Quarkus.
At the end of the day, the workshop went well and people shared some great feedback with us.
And few seconds from the lab have even been integrated in the [Devoxx FR video trailer](https://youtu.be/a0tFfx1VnQM?t=31) :)

## Voxxed Days at Luxembourg - June 2022

The path of evangelization led me to Luxembourg for a one hour talk in french named [Intégration à l'ère du cloud avec Camel Quarkus](https://cfp-voxxed-lux.yajug.org/2022/talk/HKL-0341/Integration_a_l'ere_du_cloud_avec_Camel_Quarkus). There was around 40 people attending. Based on questions from previous conferences, I demoed the enpoint DSL this time. It was well received by the audience.
The video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taCIEEQCjeM).

## J4K - September 2022
The conference finally went online, so I could attend. The knative part of the demo was first created for J4K 2021.
So, it was finally a fair return to be able to perform this presentation at J4K one year later.
The demo turned well and there was 56 attendees.
The video recording can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISf7mmU09z8).

## Devoxx Morocco - October 2022
Devoxx Morocco occurred in Taghazout that year. The Camel Quarkus workshop was noticed by the organizers and [selected for the conference](https://devoxx.ma/edition-2022/).
After few administrative hiccups, the trip to spread the Camel Quarkus knowledge in Africa was fine.
Among the 14 persons that have attended the workshop, there were a few students that showed great interest.
The questions from the professionals were mainly about the advantages of Quarkus and the available extensions. 

## Basel One - October 2022
BaselOne was a good opportunity to evangelize the [Camel Quarkus workshop](https://baselone.ch/speech.html?id=08CA4481-7EBE-44BF-B88E-5FEA9519FB18) and meet my colleague [Peter Palaga](https://github.com/ppalaga).
There was 5 attendees, surprisingly mostly students.
The first subject of interest was really to discover Quarkus, so we started on the fly presentation with Peter.
After that, the workshop went well.
In this session, one of the attendee was kind enough to show some camel routes used in production.
They were facing major challenges with route readability.
At the end of the day, they finally solved this by refining the integration architecture.
The routes becomes far more simpler after that.

## DEVFEST NANTES - October 2023
It will be a real pleasure to lead the [Camel Quarkus workshop](https://devfest2023.gdgnantes.com/en/sessions/workshop_sur_l_integration_a_l_ere_du_cloud_avec_camel_quarkus/) with my colleague [Kevin Dubois](https://www.kevindubois.com/) at DEVFEST NANTES 2023.
And this time, even with a very few attendees, we might reach the 100th persons trained ! It passes so quickly.
This will also be the first time the workshop is demonstrated with the new Camel Quarkus 3.x major release.
