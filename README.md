## J4K - October 2021

I've been selected for J4K to show Camel Quarkus running in a serverless setup.

## SnowCamp at Grenoble - February 2022

I've animated a [3 hours workshop](https://snowcamp2022.sched.com/event/qHQ9/workshop-sur-lintegration-a-lere-du-cloud-avec-camel-quarkus) about Camel Quarkus in french.
The 12 participants were really studious and grateful that the workshop was so well prepared.

[The 45 minutes talk](https://snowcamp2022.sched.com/event/qHQy/integration-a-lere-du-cloud-avec-camel-quarkus) in french was a bit challenging due to technical issues fixed at the last second.
At the end of the day, my colleague [Zineb Bendhiba](https://github.com/zbendhiba) was even able to fix the demo on the fly.
We had around 15 attendees to the talk and everyone was involved to create a great interactive exchange.

## Paris JUG - February 2022

Right after SnowCamp, it was really easy to present [Integration with Camel Quarkus in the cloud era](https://www.parisjug.org/xwiki/wiki/oldversion/view/Meeting/20220208) in french again.
There was around 40 participants with some very creative questions.
